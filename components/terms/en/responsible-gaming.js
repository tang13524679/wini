            <h3>How To Play Responsibly</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Set an amount limit. Identify a specific amount of money
                    you can afford to lose and stop when that amount of money is
                    gone.  Consider any money you spend on gambling an
                    entertainment cost.
                </li>
                <li>- Never gamble with borrowed money.</li>
                <li>- Set a time limit.</li>
                <li>
                    - Don’t gamble alone. Gamble socially with others while
                    eating or enjoying other forms of entertainment.
                </li>
                <li>- Set some of the winnings aside for other purposes.</li>
                <li>
                    - Avoid using alcohol or other drugs when gambling. They can
                    affect your judgment and interfere with your adherence to
                    your predetermined limits.
                </li>

            <h3>Protect The Minors</h3>
            <p>
                Golden-G8 only accepts and allows participation of members over
                the age of 18 and ensures all methods are used to avoid any
                attempts by minors to register and play on our Website.
                Golden-G8 reserves the right to request verification of
                identity, and if the member is of illegal age, access to the
                Website will be immediately denied. Nonetheless, the widespread
                availability and exposure to the Internet leads minors to
                register and play.
            </p>

                Therefore, we strongly recommend strict parental guidance to
                protect children from free access to gaming sites. We guarantee
                that all our campaigns and other marketing tools do not contain
                information that encourages minors to visit our site.
