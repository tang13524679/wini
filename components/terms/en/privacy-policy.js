            <h3>Anti-Money Laundering </h3>
            <p>
                In the gaming and gambling industry, customer due diligence is
                used to collect information about customers and to scan and
                evaluate this information. After this evaluation, the customer's
                existing risks are determined, and an action step is taken
                accordingly. Customer risk can be reduced with CDD. When making
                a Customer Due Diligence (CDD), information such as the full
                name, nationality, marital status, age, and contact information
                for the customer is collected. Then ID is scanned so that the
                risks are scanned. CDD is a Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure.
            </p>
            <p>
